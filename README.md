1. Business Challenge
Emerging artists and bands struggle to break through because:
They lack data-driven insights about what makes a song competitive.
They often rely only on intuition, personal taste, or costly industry gatekeepers.
Platforms like Spotify reward certain patterns (genre, length, release strategy, playlisting) that most newcomers donâ€™t fully understand.
Our company aims to solve this by analyzing trends in top Spotify songs and translating them into actionable recommendations for newcomers.
